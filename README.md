> An extension for StarUML to generate an fullstack test driven development ready .NET Core React CRUD application from a UML model. Inspired by JHipster and Yellicode bookstore tutorial. Minimalistic intended to modification for your own model driven generator technology.

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/david-skalka/StarUML-React-Core-Generator)

## Features
- Generate complete application
- Generate integration test
- Generate test data seed using fakerjs
- Generate extra actions from @UMLClass operations (e.g. SQL aggregation actions)
- Simple and modificable
- Robus @UMLModel validation
- Fast template development using Jest runner

## Primitive types
- Integer
- Text
- Decimal
- DateTime
- Bool

## Prerequisites

- staruml >=6.0.0
- net6.0 ( Core )
- Imported `assets\Profile.mfj` for new project ( The sample already has an imported profile )

## Install
1- Install **StarUML**,  [download page](http://staruml.io/download).

2- Download last release build

3- Unzip to StarUML extension user folder.

- Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\StarUML\extensions\user\staruml-react-core-generator`

## Example
1. Open `test\data\sample.mdj`
2. Change Project name using @UMLModel tag editor
3. Open (`File > Preference > React Core`) and fill Project path
4. Click on the menu (Tools > React Core ) and perform all the steps to generate the entire application
5. Run generated solution in Visual studio


## Usage
  <details>
    <summary>Define the Domain Model Using a Class Diagram</summary>
    Identify Main Data Entities: Extract key entities (e.g., users, products, orders) from the business specifications.
    Understand Attributes and Relationships: Analyze their attributes, relationships, and necessary operations.
    Add stereotypes to @UMLModel ( ReactCoreGen ), @UmlClass ( Entity ), Attributes ( Field ). Fill in their tags accordingly.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Initialize the Project</summary>
    Generate the Application: Navigate to the menu (Tools > React Core) and follow the steps to generate the entire application.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Customization</summary>
    Create Prototype: Focus on entity relationships and validate them.
    Specify Action Behavior: Customize the specified actions and then make minor UI changes.
    Code Merging: Be cautious when fully customizations before modifying the UML model.
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Continuous Application Updates</summary>
    Version Control: Utilize version control systems to merge new UML model changes into the customized application.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</summary>
    Use execution tests for customizing API actions, rather than using Swagger UI or the React client.
    Insights TDD application: Ensure 100% test coverage for your application. Use the test coverage report for insights into the application architecture and its test cases.
    Benefits: TDD provides faster development and improved code quality through easier refactoring. Ensures bugs are detected and fixed early, resulting in a more robust and maintainable codebase.
  </details>
    

<details>
  <summary>Deploying the Application Using Continuous Deployment (CD)</summary>
Test Execution: It is critical to execute tests using a continuous integration server (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure all tests in the repository pass. Disable application deployment unless all tests succeed.
    </details>



    








## Roadmap
- Many to many relation

## How to modify
1. Copy `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\StarUML\extensions\user\staruml-react-core-generator` to custom folder
2. Open in VS code
3. `npm run export-metadata` for save sample.mdj as sample.json
4. Execute ejs template by `test\render-templates.test.js` using Jest test runner and check output of template in console
